                    <p class="texto-blancoA">When a mountain fell on Mordekaiser, he took it as a sign from the Gods of Metal that his demonically-ordained task to bring metal to the masses was done, that he had achieved full metal. He knew he would one day be reborn, but as time passed, his wait became a slumber. The crushing mountain was an evil peak of black metal and cursed rock. Upon its highest summit, the gleaming, obsidian haft of a snarling axe protruded from the rock. Legends grew around this cursed place, legends that foretold whosoever drew the axe from the mountain would be the true herald of a new age of metal.</p>

                    <p class="texto-blancoB">Karthus embarked on a solo career in Bilgewater, earning a crust as a hooded reciter of funeral dirges. This had an unexpected health benefit to natives of Bilgewater, as people started looking after themselves rather than have to put their families through such an ordeal. Karthus made a career touring squalid dive bars to sing at the drunken wakes of murdered pirates instead - what with grim dirges being a vast improvement on sea-shanties.</p>

                    <p class="texto-blancoA">A golden warrior goddess from a strife-torn world, Kayle arrived in Runeterra on the back of a glittering, serpentine dragon. She searches for allies to fight an epic war against the diabolical hordes of her faithless sister. Planet Earth had failed to produce warriors of mettle, so she travelled to Runeterra in search of warriors of metal. Communicating via grand, symphonic metal operas, the depthless sorrow of her arias pierce the hearts of all who hear them. Literally.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitulo-blancoB">“...!”</h3>
                    <p class="texto-blancoB">Sona was consumed with the desire to craft soaring symphonic rock operas and tour the grandest temples of the world (and elsewhere) but no acoustics were powerful enough to satisfy her need for the most cosmically resonant sounds. Sona took ship with the doomed crew of the Serpent’s Feast to a series of volcanic islands, and began to sculpt the island with sonic brutality. There she unleashed the music of creation. So powerful were her notes, they travelled between worlds and sank entire continents (indeed, a planned gig in Atlantis had to be cancelled).</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitulo-blancoA">“MORE BASS. TURN THE BASS UP. TURN THE ******* BASS UP. MORE. MORE.”</h3>
                    <p class="texto-blancoA">Thinking he’d try something new, Yorick chose to vacation in the sun-bleached wastes of Shurima. Sunlight was something new to him, something he normally avoided for fear of people recoiling from a face not even a mother could love. His unique bass was the perfect tool to crush the soft rock of Shurima, but often had the side effect of liquefying the sand to a degree where many of the workers excavating distant tombs were buried alive. To many of these unfortunate souls, this was preferable to enduring another moment in the presence of a man who could literally bore rock.</p>

                    <p class="texto-blancoB">After surviving what he believed was to be his final performance, Olaf sought to drink himself to death with the deadliest booze of Runeterra. He ended up in the depths of Zaun, drinking potent sump cocktails, bragging of glory days and daring chem-jacked thugs to take them on. Olaf soon found himself embroiled in underground golem fight-clubs. Up against chem-powered giants, Olaf found his natural talent for pounding drums was also good for pounding mechanical automatons to pieces.</p>
